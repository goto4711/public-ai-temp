	* Save the configuration and/or weights of the LayersModel.
	*
	* An `IOHandler` is an object that has a `save` method of the proper
	* signature defined. The `save` method manages the storing or
	* transmission of serialized data ("artifacts") that represent the
	* model's topology and weights onto or via a specific medium, such as
	* file downloads, local storage, IndexedDB in the web browser and HTTP
	* requests to a server. TensorFlow.js provides `IOHandler`
	* implementations for a number of frequently used saving mediums, such as
	* `tf.io.browserDownloads` and `tf.io.browserLocalStorage`. See `tf.io`
	* for more details.
	*
	* This method also allows you to refer to certain types of `IOHandler`s
	* as URL-like string shortcuts, such as 'localstorage://' and
	* 'indexeddb://'.
	*
	* Example 1: Save `model`'s topology and weights to browser [local
	* storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage);
	* then load it back.
	*
	* ```js
	* const model = tf.sequential(
	*     {layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [3]})]});
	* console.log('Prediction from original model:');
	* model.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
	*
	* const saveResults = await model.save('localstorage://my-model-1');
	*
	* const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('localstorage://my-model-1');
	* console.log('Prediction from loaded model:');
	* loadedModel.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
	* ```

	* Example 2. Saving `model`'s topology and weights to browser
	* [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API);
	* then load it back.
	*
	* ```js
	* const model = tf.sequential(

	* console.log('Prediction from loaded model:');
	* loadedModel.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();

/**
* A model is a data structure that consists of `Layers` and defines inputs
* and outputs.
*
* The key difference between `tf.model` and `tf.sequential` is that
* `tf.model` is more generic, supporting an arbitrary graph (without
* cycles) of layers. `tf.sequential` is less generic and supports only a linear
* stack of layers.
*
* When creating a `tf.LayersModel`, specify its input(s) and output(s). Layers
* are used to wire input(s) to output(s).
*
* For example, the following code snippet defines a model consisting of
* two `dense` layers, with 10 and 4 units, respectively.
*
* ```js
* // Define input, which has a size of 5 (not including batch dimension).
* const input = tf.input({shape: [5]});
*
* // First dense layer uses relu activation.
* const denseLayer1 = tf.layers.dense({units: 10, activation: 'relu'});
* // Second dense layer uses softmax activation.
* const denseLayer2 = tf.layers.dense({units: 4, activation: 'softmax'});
*
* // Obtain the output symbolic tensor by applying the layers on the input.
* const output = denseLayer2.apply(denseLayer1.apply(input));
*
* // Create the model based on the inputs.
* const model = tf.model({inputs: input, outputs: output});
*
* // The model can be used for training, evaluation and prediction.
* // For example, the following line runs prediction with the model on
* // some fake data.
* model.predict(tf.ones([2, 5])).print();
* ```
* See also:
*   `tf.sequential`, `tf.loadLayersModel`.
*
* @doc {heading: 'Models', subheading: 'Creation'}
*/
function model(args) {
	return new LayersModel(args);
}
/**
* Creates a `tf.Sequential` model.  A sequential model is any model where the
* outputs of one layer are the inputs to the next layer, i.e. the model
* topology is a simple 'stack' of layers, with no branching or skipping.
*
* This means that the first layer passed to a `tf.Sequential` model should have
* a defined input shape. What that means is that it should have received an
* `inputShape` or `batchInputShape` argument, or for some type of layers
* (recurrent, Dense...) an `inputDim` argument.
*
* The key difference between `tf.model` and `tf.sequential` is that
* `tf.sequential` is less generic, supporting only a linear stack of layers.
* `tf.model` is more generic and supports an arbitrary graph (without
* cycles) of layers.
*
* Examples:
*
* ```js
* const model = tf.sequential();
*
* // First layer must have an input shape defined.
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}));
* // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));
*
* // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output, which equals
* // `[null, 4]`. The 1st dimension is the undetermined batch dimension; the
* // 2nd is the output size of the model's last layer.
* console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
* ```
*
* It is also possible to specify a batch size (with potentially undetermined
* batch dimension, denoted by "null") for the first layer using the
* `batchInputShape` key. The following example is equivalent to the above:
*
* ```js
* const model = tf.sequential();
*
* // First layer must have a defined input shape
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, batchInputShape: [null, 50]}));
* // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.
* model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));
*
* // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output.
* console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
* ```
*
* You can also use an `Array` of already-constructed `Layer`s to create
* a `tf.Sequential` model:
*
* ```js
* const model = tf.sequential({
*   layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}),
*            tf.layers.dense({units: 4})]
* });
* console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
* ```
*
* @doc {heading: 'Models', subheading: 'Creation'}
*/
function sequential(config) {
	return new Sequential(config);
}
/**
* Used to instantiate an input to a model as a `tf.SymbolicTensor`.
*
* Users should call the `input` factory function for
* consistency with other generator functions.
*
* Example:
*
* ```js
* // Defines a simple logistic regression model with 32 dimensional input
* // and 3 dimensional output.
* const x = tf.input({shape: [32]});
* const y = tf.layers.dense({units: 3, activation: 'softmax'}).apply(x);
* const model = tf.model({inputs: x, outputs: y});
* model.predict(tf.ones([2, 32])).print();
* ```
*
* Note: `input` is only necessary when using `model`. When using
* `sequential`, specify `inputShape` for the first layer or use `inputLayer`
* as the first layer.

/**
* An input layer is an entry point into a `tf.LayersModel`.

* specifying the `inputshape` or `batchInputShape` for the first layer.  It
* should not be specified explicitly. However, it can be useful sometimes,
* e.g., when constructing a sequential model from a subset of another
* sequential model's layers. Like the code snippet below shows.
*
* ```js
* // Define a model which simply adds two inputs.
* const model1 = tf.sequential();
* model1.add(tf.layers.dense({inputShape: [4], units: 3, activation: 'relu'}));
* model1.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid'}));
* model1.summary();
* model1.predict(tf.zeros([1, 4])).print();
*
* // Construct another model, reusing the second layer of `model1` while
* // not using the first layer of `model1`. Note that you cannot add the second
* // layer of `model` directly as the first layer of the new sequential model,
* // because doing so will lead to an error related to the fact that the layer
* // is not an input layer. Instead, you need to create an `inputLayer` and add
* // it to the new sequential model before adding the reused layer.
* const model2 = tf.sequential();
* // Use an inputShape that matches the input shape of `model1`'s second
* // layer.
* model2.add(tf.layers.inputLayer({inputShape: [3]}));
* model2.add(model1.layers[1]);
* model2.summary();
* model2.predict(tf.zeros([1, 3])).print();

* Masking:
*   This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number

*
* Notes on using statefulness in RNNs:
*   You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful', which means that the states
*   computed for the samples in one batch will be reused as initial states
*   for the samples in the next batch. This assumes a one-to-one mapping
*   between samples in different successive batches.
*
*   To enable statefulness:
*     - specify `stateful: true` in the layer constructor.
*     - specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing
*       if sequential model:
*         `batchInputShape=[...]` to the first layer in your model.
*       else for functional model with 1 or more Input layers:
*         `batchShape=[...]` to all the first layers in your model.
*       This is the expected shape of your inputs *including the batch size*.
*       It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100)`.
*     - specify `shuffle=False` when calling fit().
*
*   To reset the states of your model, call `.resetStates()` on either
*   a specific layer, or on your entire model.
*
* Note on specifying the initial state of RNNs
*   You can specify the initial state of RNN layers symbolically by
*   calling them with the option `initialState`. The value of
*   `initialState` should be a tensor or list of tensors representing
*   the initial state of the RNN layer.
*
*   You can specify the initial state of RNN layers numerically by
*   calling `resetStates` with the keyword argument `states`. The value of
*   `states` should be a numpy array or list of numpy arrays representing
*   the initial state of the RNN layer.
*
* Note on passing external constants to RNNs
*   You can pass "external" constants to the cell using the `constants`
*   keyword argument of `RNN.call` method. This requires that the `cell.call`
*   method accepts the same keyword argument `constants`. Such constants
*   can be used to condition the cell transformation on additional static
*   inputs (not changing over time), a.k.a. an attention mechanism.

*
* Arguments:

*
*    oneHot: Encodes each individual element in the input into an
*      array of `numTokens` size, containing a 1 at the element index. If
*      the last dimension is size 1, will encode on that dimension. If the
*      last dimension is not size 1, will append a new dimension for the
*      encoded output.
*
*    multiHot: Encodes each sample in the input into a single array
*     of `numTokens` size, containing a 1 for each vocabulary term
*     present in the sample. Treats the last dimension as the sample
*     dimension, if input shape is `(..., sampleLength)`, output shape
*     will be `(..., numTokens)`.
*
*    count: Like `multiHot`, but the int array contains a count of
*     the number of times the token at that index appeared in the sample.
*
*  For all output modes, currently only output up to rank 2 is supported.
*   Call arguments:
*    inputs: A 1D or 2D tensor of integer inputs.
*    countWeights: A tensor in the same shape as `inputs` indicating the
*    weight for each sample value when summing up in `count` mode. Not used
*    in `multiHot` or `oneHot` modes.

* (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/preprocessing_layers).
*
* Arguments:
*

*   A positive float (fraction of original width), or a tuple of size 2
*   representing lower and upper bound for resizing vertically.
*   When represented as a single float, this value is used for both the upper

*   amount in the range `[-20%, +30%]`. `factor=0.2` results in an output
*   with width changed by a random amount in the range `[-20%, +20%]`.
* interpolation:

	* We can think of the elements of this iterator as 'rows' (even if they are
	* nested structures).  By the same token, consecutive values for a given
	* key within the elements form a 'column'.  This matches the usual sense of
	* 'row' and 'column' when processing tabular data (e.g., parsing a CSV).
	*
	* Thus, "column-major" means that the resulting batch is a (potentially
	* nested) structure representing the columns.  Each column entry, then,
	* contains a collection of the values found in that column for a range of
	* input elements.  This representation allows for vectorized computation, in
	* contrast to the row-major form.
	*
	* The inputs should all have the same nested structure (i.e., of arrays and
	* dicts).  The result is a single object with the same nested structure,
	* where the leaves are arrays collecting the values of the inputs at that
	* location (or, optionally, the result of a custom function applied to those
	* arrays).
	*
	* @param batchSize The number of elements desired per batch.
	* @param smallLastBatch Whether to emit the final batch when it has fewer
	*   than batchSize elements. Default true.
	* @param zipFn: (optional) A function that expects an array of elements at a
	*   single node of the object tree, and returns a `DeepMapResult`.  The
	*   `DeepMapResult` either provides a result value for that node (i.e.,
	*   representing the subtree), or indicates that the node should be processed
	*   recursively.  The default zipFn recurses as far as possible and places
	*   arrays at the leaves.
	* @returns A `LazyIterator` of batches of elements, represented as an object
	*   with collections at the leaves.
